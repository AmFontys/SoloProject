This enterprise context may contain multiple stakeholders with different interests, is research heavy, has social impact, and may have legal, ethical, intercultural and sustainable considerations. <br>
You apply critical thinking in your day-to-day work and while doing research. 
Each of the research results can be validated and is relevant and valuable for your specific context.

You use a well-known methodology (for instance the DOT framework) to structure your research. 
You use research results to advice stakeholders.
Your final solution is designed with the possibility for future further development and is transferrable.
You deliver professional products according to planning, which is the result of solving problems in a structured and methodical approach.  <br>
You demonstrate a critical view towards your own and other people’s work. You use appropriate communication considering your role in a team, your audience and the medium to convey your message and results of your software development process.

### What I Will do

## Investigative Problem-Solving
You deliver professional products according to planning, which is the result of solving problems in a structured and methodical approach. You demonstrate a critical view towards your own and other people’s work. <br>
You apply critical thinking in your day-to-day work. In your planning, you can identify work that needs further investigation. Each investigation works towards an answer which can be validated and is relevant and valuable for your specific context.

You use a well-known methodology (for instance the DOT framework) to structure your investigation. 
You analyze the problem from multiple viewpoints. A suitable solution is chosen. Where the result is validated to demonstrate its quality and value. 
You can justify and present your work professionally, both verbally and in writing. 
Your investigations are understandable by your target audience, repeatable, and can be validated by others.  

### What I Will do

## Personal Leadership
Leadership means that you can proactively define your own personal and technical goals and follow-up actions. 
You reflect on your actions and results, on your own initiative formulate well-defined feedback questions, ask and receive feedback on your goals and actions.  <br>
You reflect on received feedback and act upon it to improve your work.
You know which role you will play in a team. <br>
You are aware of developments in the field of software engineering and based on these observations you adjust your personal development plans.  <br>
The preparing for graduation or finding a minor should be part of your plan (for instance, by finding minors or graduation assignments that fit your ambitions).

### What I Will do

## Scalable Architectures
Besides functionality, you develop architecture of an enterprise software based on explicitly stated software quality requirements. <br>
You explicitly focus on quality requirements most relevant to your projects’ contexts. 

Quality requirements dictated by law (eg.GDPR) and ethics (eg. security) must always be addressed.
You design your system with future adaptation in mind. You assess the extent in which the quality requirements are met by your software implementation.

Software is a composition of the source code, data, infrastructure and runtime.  <br>
Relevant quality requirements are expressed as non-functional requirements and are directly derived from the project context.
Your choice of technologies in the project should fit the non-functional requirements and be supportive for the system architecture realisation. 

You investigate architectural patterns that work well in the context of your projects. 
Your chosen architecture must support verifiably multiple relevant quality requirements as defined in the projects (for instance security, scalability, robustness, performance, availability, responsiveness and accessibility).

### What I Will do

## Development and Operations (DevOps)
You set up environments, tools and processes which support your continuous software development process. <br>
Your deployment environment supports this by being able to deploy an integrated software system and monitor the running parts of your application for quality attributes. <br>
Your software is available to developers and other stakeholders during development and in production environment. 

Your software runs independently from your local host and is presentable to stakeholders on demand. 
All parts of your software are at all times integrated. 
You define environments which will be used by developers in the development and creation of software.  <br>
These infrastructure environments are defined using ‘Infrastructure as code’ principles and transferrable to the stakeholders. 

You chose a deployment strategy to deploy reliably and repeatedly while aiming for a zero downtime in a non-local environment. 
You support automated testing and measurements which prove the quality of the software (for instance code coverage, security assessment, support for monitoring).  <br>
You investigate which software performance indicators you will need to collect and monitor those while the software is running.  <br>
You validate that your application automatically scales under realistic loads and using your performance indicators as measures to confirm it. You automate all the above (for instance using CI/CD principles).

### What I Will do

## Targeted Interaction
You use appropriate communication considering your role in a team, your audience and the medium to convey your message and results of your software development process.  <br>
Together with your team, you agree upon a way of working that is considered professional in a large IT software organization and that enables you to communicate with stakeholders about the progress and results of your project.

You have an active attitude to share your ideas, viewpoints, technical knowledge and experiences in or outside your team that contribute to an improvement of solutions or software development process. 
Besides requirements needed by direct stakeholders, you also take other viewpoints into account which are relevant (for instance GDPR, ethical & legal issues).  

### What I Will do

## Cloud Native
You deploy (parts of) your application to a cloud platform. You integrate cloud services (for example: Serverless computing, cloud storage, container management) into your software, and can explain the added value of these cloud services for your software quality. <br>
You develop software that is completely or partially composed of cloud services. 
You investigate what tools, architecture design and best practices you need to follow to develop your software such that it can take full advantage of the cloud native landscape now and in the future. <br>
You estimate the total cost of software ownership in the cloud and take precautions to reduce it. <br>
In your architectural decisions you discuss the increase of the software qualities caused by using off-the-shelf cloud services and cloud technologies.

### What I Will do

## Security by Design
You investigate how to minimize security risks for your application, and you incorporate best practices in your whole software development process. <br>
You investigate which security risks are most common (for instance OWASP top 10) and you investigate which best practices are used to prevent security risks for all steps in your software development process.

You create non-functional and functional requirements focused on security. 
You use common techniques (for instance misuse cases, trust boundaries) in analysis and design of your architecture. 
You implement common techniques (for instance authentication and authorization or sql injection prevention) which prevent common security breaches.  <br>
You also design for, and test steps to mitigate breaches when they still occur.

### What I Will do

## Distributed Data
Create non-functional and functional requirements focused on data storage and handling.   <br>
You thoroughly investigate which data storages are most supportive towards the non-functional requirements of your architecture. <br>
You select data storage alternatives based on an estimated data volume, access pattern and data variety. <br>
You identify the sensitive data in your software and take precautions to protect it. 
You apply legal requirements in your design and implementation (for instance GDPR), and you are aware of ethical issues while handling and storing sensitive data.
